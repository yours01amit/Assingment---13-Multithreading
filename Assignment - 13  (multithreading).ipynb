    "Q1. what is multithreading in python? hy is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Multithreading in Python refers to the ability to run multiple threads (lightweight sub-processes) simultaneously within a single program. Each thread is an independent flow of control that can execute concurrently with other threads in the same program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python and other programming languages to achieve concurrency and parallelism, which can help improve the performance and responsiveness of certain types of applications. Specifically, multithreading can be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve responsiveness: By running long-running tasks in a separate thread, the main thread can continue to respond to user input and handle other tasks without getting blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilize multiple CPUs/cores: On a multi-core CPU, multithreading can be used to distribute the workload across multiple cores, allowing the program to execute more tasks simultaneously and potentially improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplify code: Multithreading can help simplify code by allowing multiple tasks to be executed concurrently in a more natural and intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called threading. The threading module provides a way to create and manage threads in a Python program. It includes functions for starting and stopping threads, as well as for synchronizing threads and sharing data between them."

    "   \n",
    "1. activeCount()\n",
    "2. currentThread()\n",
    "3. enumerate()\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  The threading module in Python is used to create and manage threads within a Python program. A thread is a separate flow of execution that can run in parallel with other threads in the same program, allowing the program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common reasons why the threading module is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency: The threading module enables concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program, allowing the program to make progress on multiple tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource sharing: Threads can share resources like memory and CPU time, which can make a program more efficient and reduce overall processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming: Threads can be used to perform tasks asynchronously, allowing a program to continue executing while a thread waits for I/O or other time-consuming operations to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "GUI programming: In GUI programming, the use of threads is essential to keep the GUI responsive while performing background tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Network programming: The threading module is often used in network programming to manage multiple connections simultaneously, allowing a server to handle multiple clients at the same time."

    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Increased Complexity: Multithreaded applications can be more complex and harder to debug than single-threaded applications. The interactions between threads can be difficult to manage, and race conditions and deadlocks can occur.\n",

    "2.Synchronization Overhead: Synchronization is necessary to ensure that threads access shared resources in a thread-safe manner, but it adds overhead to the application. Synchronization can also lead to performance degradation if not implemented properly.\n",

    "3.Memory Overhead: Each thread requires its own stack and program counter, which can increase memory usage in a multithreaded application.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: Deadlocks and race conditions are two common issues that can occur in multi-threaded programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting indefinitely for each other to release a resource they need to proceed. Essentially, each thread is waiting for the other to release a resource before it can continue. This can result in a situation where none of the threads can proceed, and the program becomes stuck. Deadlocks can occur when there are multiple threads competing for limited resources, such as shared memory or locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions occur when two or more threads access a shared resource and try to modify it at the same time. The outcome of such a situation depends on the order in which the threads execute, and can result in unpredictable behavior. For example, if two threads are trying to increment the same variable at the same time, the final value of the variable may be different depending on the order in which the threads execute. Race conditions can lead to bugs that are difficult to reproduce and fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both deadlocks and race conditions are common problems in concurrent programming and can be difficult to diagnose and fix. They can be avoided by carefully designing the program to minimize shared resources, using proper synchronization techniques such as locks or semaphores, and avoiding operations that may have side effects or rely on undefined behavior.\n",
